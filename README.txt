These are some basic utility functions for EasyUO Ultima Online assistant.

These scripts are intended to be used as one-liners inside your script. All of them should be invoked using the "call" statement inside your main script and specifying some input arguments. Place them inside the same folder with your EUO application (exe).

Most of them are more or less commented. Most of the comments are in my broken (and often very tired) English, however some happen to be in czech. I am sorry =). If you need some more info on how to use them, try to look inside the "examples/" folder. Please keep in mind, that most of them are remnants of my EUO beginnings and have not been changed since I first started to program for this assistant. The programming style and coding conventions vary slightly across my code, reflecting different periods the code was written in.

There are no license or copyright burdens on my code. If you gonna use it, beer would be appreciated though =).

All the scripts are distributed without any warranty, bla bla bla, and you should use them at your own complacency (oh yeah and risk too).
